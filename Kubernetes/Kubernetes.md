### <b> Configuration management </b>
Configuration management in the context of Kubernetes refers to the management of configuration settings and resources within a Kubernetes cluster using software tools and practices. Kubernetes itself provides native mechanisms for managing configurations, but additional tools can be used to enhance the configuration management process.

Here are some key aspects of configuration management in Kubernetes:

1. **Declarative Configuration**: Kubernetes uses a declarative approach to define the desired state of your infrastructure. You describe the desired configuration of your cluster, including deployments, services, volumes, and other resources, in YAML or JSON manifests.

2. **Kubernetes Config Files**: Kubernetes config files are used to define and manage the configuration of Kubernetes resources. These files contain specifications for pods, deployments, services, ingress rules, and more. They define the desired state of the resources and can be version controlled and managed as code.

3. **Configuration Repositories**: Configuration management in Kubernetes often involves storing configuration files in version control systems like Git. This enables tracking changes, collaboration, and managing different environments or clusters with different configurations.

4. **Configuration Templates**: Tools like Helm can be used to manage Kubernetes configuration templates. Helm allows you to define reusable and parameterized templates for creating Kubernetes resources. This simplifies the management of complex configurations and promotes code reuse.

5. **Configuration Validation**: Kubernetes provides mechanisms for validating configurations before applying them to the cluster. Tools like kubeval or kube-score can be used to validate Kubernetes manifests against best practices, ensuring that the configurations are correct and conform to recommended guidelines.

6. **Configuration Deployment**: Configuration management tools can help automate the deployment of Kubernetes configurations. Tools like kubectl, kustomize, or deployment pipelines can be used to apply and update configurations in a controlled manner, ensuring consistency and minimizing errors.

7. **Secrets Management**: Configuration management also includes managing sensitive information, such as API keys, passwords, and certificates, as Kubernetes secrets. Tools like Vault or Kubernetes-native secrets management can be used to securely store and manage these secrets within the cluster.
